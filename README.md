## Overview
This is the first project of many that I plan to build on front-end mentor. This is a simple responsive QR code component built using basic CSS and media queries. I wanted to challenge myself by not using flexbox in this one.

## My process
- I always start by resetting all the default browser styles so I can start styling from scratch.
- I split the website into a section that contains the card and a footer.
- Inside the section element is a card element that I centered on the page using a nifty little trick consisting of absolute positioning and the translate function.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3

### What I learned
- This project was my first time using Figma. It was a good experience seeing an emnulation of how a front-end developer and a designer communicate with each other.
- I learned how to use CSS variables.
